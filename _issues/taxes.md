description: 'Taxing everyone fairly'

To sustain our society, we have to tax our citizens. However, it's important to tax everyone fairly and equally without loopholes.

Simple Progressive Taxes
========================

Although our country uses progressive taxes already, they are now extremely convoluted due to all the changes that have been made over time. There are countless tax credits that are allowed, and some sources of income are taxed differently than others. To bring us back to a simpler system and level the playing field for all, all income should be taxed the same way in a pregressive tax system that is tied to inflation (so taxes change with the value of the dollar). The only tax deductions shoud either come from campaign contributions or from punchasing a product that is good for the environment (this is to incentivize consumers to buy more environmentally friendly products even if they may be a little more expensive). This would greatly simplify the tax code and make it easy for most people to figure out how much they would pay in taxes. Lastly, the largest tax bracket only goes up to about $400,000 - any income above that amount is all taxed at the same rate. The United States should add more tax brackets above $400,000 to tax income well above that amount (such as in the millions) at a higher rate.

The Fairness of Progressive Taxes
---------------------------------

With progressive taxes, everyone pays the same rate per tax bracket. However, there are set points at which money earned over that point will be taxed at a higher rate (see above for a more detailed description). At first, the fairest option may seem to be to tax all money at a flat rate (this is called a flat tax). However, this actually puts a much greater burden on the poor. The poor may have a lot of trouble paying a certain percentage such as 10%, while the rich would have no problem paying 10% because a smaller part of their money is used for the bare necessities. With a progressive taxation system, those who make more money will end up paying more because they are the ones who have benefitted most from the system, and they have more of a responsibility to keep it functioning in a healthy manner (see below for why this is good for the economy). Furthermore, progressive taxes put an equal burden on both the rich and poor, so that nobody is affected more by taxes than anyone else.

Economic Benefits
-----------------

Progressive taxes are not only fair, but they also help the economy. With progressive taxes, an equal burden is placed on all classes. The higher taxes in the higher tax brackets end up taxing money that is less likely to be spent anyways, and puts it into public projects such as infrastructure improvement. This helps put money back into the economy and provide jobs for people, resulting in a stronger and bigger middle class. This means that there are more people with additional spending money to buy more products, which boosts the economy.

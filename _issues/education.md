A well-educated, highly-skilled population is necessary for ensuring a productive and competitive work force. Education is also essential in creating economic upward mobility, building a strong middle class, and protecting American jobs. We must make education a national priority and provide a robust public education to all students. 

K-12
================

Funding
-------

The problem at the core of our failing public school system is funding. Currently, schools are funded locally, not federally. Because of this, poorer areas cannot afford to provide a quality education to their youth, and this pertpetuates a cycle of poverty - if the youth aren't well-educated, they are much less likely to get a job. To combat this issue, schools should be federally funded based on the number of students - this way, all areas would have an equal chance, and poorer areas could be lifted out of poverty and provided a good school system.

Competiton
----------

Currently, public schools face little competiton. Private schools are very difficult to afford for most families, and charter schools accept a small number of students. If parents were allowed to choose the school that their children would attend (within a certain radius), schools would be forced to increase their level of education in order to compete with nearby schools. Financially rewarding the schools that attract more students would make it in every school's best interest to provide the most comprehensive education in the area, causing a race to the top in our public school system.

Preparing Students
------------------

While it is an important right of municipalities to be able to choose what its youth will learn, there are certain areas in which a student must be proficient in to succeed at life in the United States. For this reason, we propose two required courses:

### US Citizenship

This course will teach students how to complete basic tasks that are necessary living as a citizen in the US, such as filing tax returns, dealing with jury duty, voting, and searching for a job. Currently, these tasks are rarely taught, and leave students in a difficult position when they leave high school.

### Comprehensive Sexual Education

Right now, the US is suffering from a huge number of unwanted teen pregrancies as well as sexually transmitted diseases. To combat these major issues, it is important that students be informed about sex in order to make their own decisions. This includes common methods of birth control and how to choose, as well as what options students have available should they become pregnant. In addition, methods for preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases must also be taught and discussed.

Higher Education
================

### Free Public Universities

To ensure that access to higher education is as wide-spread as possible, we must use tax dollars to fund public universities and make tuition free. Providing free higher education will bring prices down at private colleges, which will have to compete with free public universities. Free higher education will also alleviate issues with student debt, because all public school students will graduate debt-free.

### Eliminate Unecessary Costs at Public Universities

We believe that the cost of higher education can be reduced by cutting back on unecessary expenses: building new flashy buildings and sports facilities, maintaining huge bureaucracies of paid staff, and paying for expensive food options. We must find ways to better manage costs and provide a good education while avoiding unecessary expenditures.

### Steer Students Away From Risky Colleges

### Stop Using SAT and ACT Scores
The SAT and ACT are expensive tests designed and administered by private organizations which make hundreds of millions of dollars from fees levied on students. The usage of private test scores for admission to public colleges and universities should end.

Issue Ideas
===========

Stefan's First Proposal
-----------------------

### Education
- merit-based pay
- civic course: add "what are your rights," loans
- easier to fire teachers

### Voting
- Direct elections
- Oregin system - auto-register all 18-year-olds
- Move elections to a weekend or make "Democracy Day"
- Overturn Citizens United
- Move local elections to weekends or day of national/state elections
- System for ensuring there are enough places to vote
- Redraw districts based on geography
- Limit campaign spending to $100, give every citizen a $100 tax credit for donating
- Easier process for introducing referendums and recalls/impeachment
- **Politicians must be rewarded for greater good**

### Inequality
- Need change in attitude in police forces
- Investigate forces with disproportionately high rates of shootings + killings
- Programs to increase confidence/trust

### Misc
- Regulate pharmaceuticals
- Take out doctor+lawyer boards that limit amounts of doctors+lawyers

Stefan's Second Proposal
------------------------

### Education
- What to do about CollegeBoard? SAT's + AP's are expensive, clearly favor the rich *but* also provide more advanced courses
- Designate colleges "risky" based on student loan default rate. Do not grant loans for those schools, but promote schools that leave grads able to pay back
- Standardized testing - *is it necessary?*

### Military
- Dismantle nukes, slim down arsenal. We already have enough to destroy the world many times over. Use extra $ to dispose of them safely+long-term
- Greater emphasis on special forces and smaller standing armies
- Better psychological care, better+more effective V.A. â†’ how to fix V.A.?
- Beware rising pension costs
- Boost cyber-security and cyber-warfare capabilities - encourage computer science in schools and public universities
- Rebuild secure + critical infrastructure
- We applaud steps to use private businesses (like NASA tasking companies to make space shuttles). Much cheaper + more effectiveR
    - Research how much is thought to have been saved

### Immigration
- Building a wall or adding security is expensive and doesn't fix the underlying problem. We need to think of ways to help Mexico be a safer place
- Take in Syrian refugees - educated professionals

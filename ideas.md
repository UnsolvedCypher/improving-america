Issue Ideas
===========

Stefan's First Proposal
-----------------------

### Education
- merit-based pay
- civic course: add "what are your rights," loans
- easier to fire teachers

### Voting
- Direct elections
- Oregin system - auto-register all 18-year-olds
- Move elections to a weekend or make "Democracy Day"
- Overturn Citizens United
- Move local elections to weekends or day of national/state elections
- System for ensuring there are enough places to vote
- Redraw districts based on geography
- Limit campaign spending to $100, give every citizen a $100 tax credit for donating
- Easier process for introducing referendums and recalls/impeachment
- **Politicians must be rewarded for greater good**

### Inequality
- Need change in attitude in police forces
- Investigate forces with disproportionately high rates of shootings + killings
- Programs to increase confidence/trust

### Misc
- Regulate pharmaceuticals
- Take out doctor+lawyer boards that limit amounts of doctors+lawyers

Stefan's Second Proposal
------------------------

### Education
- What to do about CollegeBoard? SAT's + AP's are expensive, clearly favor the rich *but* also provide more advanced courses
- Designate colleges "risky" based on student loan default rate. Do not grant loans for those schools, but promote schools that leave grads able to pay back
- Standardized testing - *is it necessary?*

### Military
- Dismantle nukes, slim down arsenal. We already have enough to destroy the world many times over. Use extra $ to dispose of them safely+long-term
- Greater emphasis on special forces and smaller standing armies
- Better psychological care, better+more effective V.A. â†’ how to fix V.A.?
- Beware rising pension costs
- Boost cyber-security and cyber-warfare capabilities - encourage computer science in schools and public universities
- Rebuild secure + critical infrastructure
- We applaud steps to use private businesses (like NASA tasking companies to make space shuttles). Much cheaper + more effectiveR
    - Research how much is thought to have been saved

### Immigration
- Building a wall or adding security is expensive and doesn't fix the underlying problem. We need to think of ways to help Mexico be a safer place
- Take in Syrian refugees - educated professionals

Stefan's Third Proposal
-----------------------

### Military
- Although we disagree with the size of the U.S. Army, We must remember that the army is a means of teaching discipline and creates opportunity for millions of people
- Complete gener equality in the military. This means requiring women to register for slective service and opening all posts to women. Testing standards will not be changed.

### Gun Control
- Background checks required for all purchases
- Create an online ATF-administered registered gun database. This will help stop gun trafficking by letting the ATF track gun purchases as well as stolen guns

### Health Care
- Limit "intense care" Medicare payouts to nursing homes, which often abuse the system

### Currency
- Investigate switching to plastic bills, which are far more durable than paper bills and save money in the long term
- Stop minting pennies or find a way to make minting coins cheaper

### Native Americans
- We must not forget about Native Americans and what we have done to them in the past
- We must find ways to provide good education to Native Americans
- We must fight alcoholism, disease, and poverty on reservations

### Criminal Justice
- Provide education - books, volunteer teaching programs, internet access to prisoners
- Provide gym equipment and cycling classes to prisoners: exercise teaches discipline, has many health benefits. We are not doing enough
- We must understand that many people in the criminal justice system are not innately bad people. Everyone must be given a second chance, and we must help them become a part of society and lower recidivism
- Figure out how to prevent radicalization of non-violent offenders in prison
- Better handling of criminal records: once someone has served their time in jail, they should be equal in society and have equal opportunity
- Enforce voting rights of felons. States should not be allowed to take away their voting rights

Stefan's Fourth Proposal
------------------------

### Criminal Justice
- Implement policies to limit the use of arbitration, or to make arbitration more fair. Currently corporations are turning to arbitration to win legal battles unfairly. This is a serious violation of justice.
- Legalize (or at least decriminalize) prostitution and introduce common-sense regulation to ensure prostitutes are the safety and health of prostitutes as well as clients. We must destigmatize prostitutes and recognize most of them are desparate people who are out of options.

### Education
- Police Officers ("resource officers") should not be in schools. This creates a "fast-track" to prison for many people, especially African-American children, and breeds mistrust. Officers should only be used in extreme cases.

Issue Ideas
===========

Stefan's First Proposal
-----------------------

### Education
- merit-based pay
- civic course: add "what are your rights," loans
- easier to fire teachers

### Voting
- Direct elections
- Oregin system - auto-register all 18-year-olds
- Move elections to a weekend or make "Democracy Day"
- Overturn Citizens United
- Move local elections to weekends or day of national/state elections
- System for ensuring there are enough places to vote
- Redraw districts based on geography
- Limit campaign spending to $100, give every citizen a $100 tax credit for donating
- Easier process for introducing referendums and recalls/impeachment
- **Politicians must be rewarded for greater good**

### Inequality
- Need change in attitude in police forces
- Investigate forces with disproportionately high rates of shootings + killings
- Programs to increase confidence/trust

### Misc
- Regulate pharmaceuticals
- Take out doctor+lawyer boards that limit amounts of doctors+lawyers

Stefan's Second Proposal
------------------------

### Education
- What to do about CollegeBoard? SAT's + AP's are expensive, clearly favor the rich *but* also provide more advanced courses
- Designate colleges "risky" based on student loan default rate. Do not grant loans for those schools, but promote schools that leave grads able to pay back
- Standardized testing - *is it necessary?*

### Military
- Dismantle nukes, slim down arsenal. We already have enough to destroy the world many times over. Use extra $ to dispose of them safely+long-term
- Greater emphasis on special forces and smaller standing armies
- Better psychological care, better+more effective V.A. â†’ how to fix V.A.?
- Beware rising pension costs
- Boost cyber-security and cyber-warfare capabilities - encourage computer science in schools and public universities
- Rebuild secure + critical infrastructure
- We applaud steps to use private businesses (like NASA tasking companies to make space shuttles). Much cheaper + more effectiveR
    - Research how much is thought to have been saved

### Immigration
- Building a wall or adding security is expensive and doesn't fix the underlying problem. We need to think of ways to help Mexico be a safer place
- Take in Syrian refugees - educated professionals

Stefan's Third Proposal
-----------------------

### Military
- Although we disagree with the size of the U.S. Army, We must remember that the army is a means of teaching discipline and creates opportunity for millions of people
- Complete gener equality in the military. This means requiring women to register for slective service and opening all posts to women. Testing standards will not be changed.

### Gun Control
- Background checks required for all purchases
- Create an online ATF-administered registered gun database. This will help stop gun trafficking by letting the ATF track gun purchases as well as stolen guns

### Health Care
- Limit "intense care" Medicare payouts to nursing homes, which often abuse the system

### Currency
- Investigate switching to plastic bills, which are far more durable than paper bills and save money in the long term
- Stop minting pennies or find a way to make minting coins cheaper
a
### Native Americans
- We must not forget about Native Americans and what we have done to them in the past
- We must find ways to provide good education to Native Americans
- We must fight alcoholism, disease, and poverty on reservations

### Criminal Justice
- Provide education - books, volunteer teaching programs, internet access to prisoners
- Provide gym equipment and cycling classes to prisoners: exercise teaches discipline, has many health benefits. We are not doing enough
- We must understand that many people in the criminal justice system are not innately bad people. Everyone must be given a second chance, and we must help them become a part of society and lower recidivism
- Figure out how to prevent radicalization of non-violent offenders in prison
- Better handling of criminal records: once someone has served their time in jail, they should be equal in society and have equal opportunity
- Enforce voting rights of felons. States should not be allowed to take away their voting rights

Stefan's Fourth Proposal
------------------------

### Criminal Justice
- Implement policies to limit the use of arbitration, or to make arbitration more fair. Currently corporations are turning to arbitration to win legal battles unfairly. This is a serious violation of justice.
- Legalize (or at least decriminalize) prostitution and introduce common-sense regulation to ensure prostitutes are the safety and health of prostitutes as well as clients. We must destigmatize prostitutes and recognize most of them are desparate people who are out of options.
- Outlaw pay-to-stay charges at jails and prisons at all levels of government. These practices punish the poorest members of society and makes it even more difficult for ex-felons to rejoin society. In most cases it also doesn't even raise that much money either. [article](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34705968)
- Raise the age for people to be tried as juveniles to at least twenty for nonserious crimes (this requires further research) [article](http://ctmirror.org/2015/11/06/malloy-raise-the-age-for-juvenile-justice-system-to-20/)

### Education
- Police Officers ("resource officers") should not be in schools. This creates a "fast-track" to prison for many people, especially African-American children, and breeds mistrust. Officers should only be used in extreme cases
- Ban corporal punishment in schools. Corporal punishment promotes violence in society and is very damaging and disruptive to learning environments. It is damaging to physical and mental health and leaves students far worse off than before. We should look into ways of promoting Restorative Justice instead.
- It appears that due to Common Core testing standards, younger and younger children must spend more time taking tests and learning in a rigid manner (see [article](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/01/08/462279629/why-kindergarten-is-the-new-first-grade)). Children, especially young children, must be given time to play, have fun, and explore subjects they like (this is important in developing creativity). 
- Universal Pre-K. Emulate the French system. 

### Poverty
- Reference: Low voter turnout among poor and people who benefit from federal/state aid programs [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/opinion/sunday/who-turned-my-blue-state-red.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0)
- Reference: Food stamp fraud [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/us/food-stamp-fraud-in-the-underground-economy.html)

### Obesity
- Consider requiring health warnings on beverages that contain added sweeteners. This may help reduce obesity by reducing consumption of high-sugar, high-calorie drinks.

### Economy
- We favor using the GPI, the [Genuine Progress Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genuine_progress_indicator), over GDP as a measure of our economy's and country's health. The GPI takes into account environmental damage and social costs in the final value for a country's economic production, giving a better measure of progress.

### Reproductive Rights
- Subsidize birth control methods. Families of all incomes have the right to choose when to have children and how many children they want. Access to affordable birth control is also one of the best tools for fighting poverty and empowering women, many of whom are dragged into poverty as a result of having children.
- Although women fulfill a truly essential role in our society, bearing the next generation of Americans, they are often punished for their hard work. Having children hurts a woman's career and is very expensive in terms of money, time, and energy. A tax break or child support fee paid out to pregnant women and mothers of underage children would help thank women for their hard work and at the same time make edducation and child care more affordable.

### Environment
- Impose a significant plastic bottle deposit or tax to limit the use of plastic bottles, which cause devastating pollution. Funds raised from this program can be used to fund environmental research and protection.
- Impose a significant plastic bag tax (greater than $0.10 and up to $0.25 per bag) to incentivize the use of eco-friendly, re-usable shopping bags. Funds raised from this program can be used to fund environmental research and protection.
- Look into ecoagriculture and laws implemented by California to combat drought.

### Agriculture
- Firmly regulate the use of antibiotics in livestock, with the goal of greatly reducing preventative antibiotic usage.
- Look into effectiveness of current agricultural subsidies, including ethanol policies
